# Netflix-and-Netflix-Stocks-Analysis
In this project i do data analysis of Netflix using python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and many more. Anazyling the correct data,and make it valuable is a crucial part, it contains a lot of duplicate and null values which makes data messy but these libraries are make it so simple and I also created Netflix Power BI dashboard.
